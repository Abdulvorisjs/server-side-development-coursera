# sever-side-development-coursera

This repository dedicated for course which I took [Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs) from [Coursera.org](https://www.somewebsite.com)

**About the course**
This course deals with all things server-side. We base the entire course around the NodeJS platform. We start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: **HTTP** and **HTTPS**. We examine **NodeJS** and **NodeJS modules**:
**Express** for building web servers. On the database side, we review basic CRUD operations, **NoSQL databases**, in particular **MongoDB** and **Mongoose** for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. We examine the **REST** concepts and building a **RESTful API**. We touch upon authentication and security. Finally we review **backend as a service (BaaS)** approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services.

I have learnt from the course 

- *Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST*
- *Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework*
- *Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services*
